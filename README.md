**DLProject — Character-Level Transformer Language Model**

This repository contains our implementation of the Deep Learning Mini Project for the course, where we build a decoder-only Transformer language model trained on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
The goal of the project is to understand and implement key components of the Transformer architecture from scratch, train the model, and generate Shakespeare like text.
